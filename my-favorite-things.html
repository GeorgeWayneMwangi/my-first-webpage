      <h1>My Favorite things!</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to my freakshow.</h2>
      <p>Hey guys. My name is George Wayne.</p>
      <p>I am a Marine Engineering student.</p>
      <p>However,due to the pandemic,I now have a chance to explore some of my hobbies that I could not due to time constraints</p>
      <p>This include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ANIME</li>
        <li>coding</li>
        <li>ANIME <em>just incase you missed the first entry..lol</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I still have my normal classes but they are a drag and trying something new at Moringa School will for sure help me out in the future.</p>
      <p>I am excited in joining a family that is goal oriented and whom we can share our dreams together as we conquer this daunting yet satisfying field of software development.</p>
      <p>I will continue improving my coding skills. So watch this space:)</p>
      <p>Oh,before I forget. Long live the Black Bulls!</p>
